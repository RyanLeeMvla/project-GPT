July 14th: "big changes, Kanban working, inventory kinda working, next steps are audio implementation when WIFI permits, and also more dev testing the seperate features to see if they work. Maybe also create an adaptive code system, where when we have something like that action undefined, we actual rewrite the code on the spot. Would be cool, also requires graphical UI that says like 'rewriting app,' and locks interacterables"

July 15th: ✅ ADAPTIVE CODE SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED! Now when you ask for new features, the app can generate and implement them in real-time. Complete with "Rewriting App" UI that locks interactions during generation. Features natural conversation flow - no hardcoded responses.

Next steps: 
✅ Adaptive code system - COMPLETED with full feature generation, workflow management, and safety backups
-audio implementation when WIFI permits
-more dev testing the seperate features to see if they work
-addition of actual system monitoring, as it is currently running on placeholders
-CONSIDER REFACTORING: Move adaptive system to separate files for better organization
-System Monitoring - Replace fake CPU/memory data with real system calls
-GPT API Health Checks - Real API ping testing and status monitoring
-Project Data Persistence - Move from memory to database/file storage
-3D Printer Integration - Connect to actual printer APIs (OctoPrint, etc.)
-Settings Persistence - Save user preferences to localStorage/files
-Real-time Updates - Implement polling/websockets for live data
-Enhanced Error Recovery - Adaptive error handling system you mentioned
-Notes System Enhancement - Full CRUD operations with persistence\

Problems:
- Inventory item not found - When asking to remove Print Bed Adhesive Item
- Double GPT Response to Feature Request - Responds twice, with different intents

Known-Good Solutions:
- If the app isn't responsing, check for duplicate class declarations in app.js:
  * Look for "Identifier 'ClassName' has already been declared" errors
  * Use grep to find duplicate classes: grep "class ClassName" src/ui/app.js  
  * Remove the duplicate class definition (usually the second one)
  * Common duplicates: PerformanceTimer, LoadingManager
  * ✅ FIXED: Duplicate PerformanceTimer class causing UI unresponsiveness
  * ✅ FIXED: Duplicate LoadingManager class causing UI unresponsiveness


- ✅ FIXED: sendCommand method error - Changed to use processCommand in main.js
- ✅ FIXED: Code generation returning undefined - Modified processCommand to handle codeGeneration model type correctly
- ✅ FIXED: Database parameter mapping error - Fixed note_taking action to pass correct data structure to addNote method
- ✅ FIXED: Action result format mismatch - Standardized note_taking results to include success/error format expected by frontend
- ✅ FIXED: Notes UI not displaying - Updated loadNotes() function to fetch from database and added get-notes IPC handler

- ✅ FIXED: JSON parsing error in adaptive system - added error handling and response cleaning
- ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Dual-model system for optimal performance and cost

Testing Results:
✅ Adaptive System Working: Intent detection, conversation flow, and modal UI all functional
✅ Notes feature generation triggered successfully
✅ JSON parsing errors now handled with fallback system
✅ Model optimization: GPT-3.5-turbo for chat, GPT-4o for code generation

Model Strategy:
🗨️ Regular Chat: GPT-3.5-turbo (fast, economical)
🔧 Code Generation: GPT-4o (powerful, accurate coding)
🧠 Complex Reasoning: o1-preview (advanced logic)
🔄 Fallback: GPT-4-turbo (reliable backup)


Ok, let me break down my desired workflow. The user inputs in text or voice. An AI Driven, NOT hardcoded, response is parsed from the input, and generated. In that same process, the input is scanned for the User's intent to create a new feature. If detected, the AI begins the feature creation workflow. From here on forward, it follows like this: [User input] --> (Feature request detected) --> [First set of clarifying questions from agent] --> User response --> [Confirmation request from AI] --> [User confrim] --> [agent action]. Ability for user to quit at any time
